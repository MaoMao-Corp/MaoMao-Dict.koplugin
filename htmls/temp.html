These words agree in representing a person as <i>giving up</i> or <i>leaving</i> some object, but differ as to the mode of doing it. The distinctive sense of abandon is that of giving up a thing absolutely and finally; as, to abandon one's friends, places, opinions, good or evil habits, a hopeless enterprise, a shipwrecked vessel. <i>Abandon</i> is more widely applicable than <i>forsake</i> or <i>desert</i>. The Latin original of <i>desert</i> appears to have been originally applied to the case of deserters from military service. Hence, the verb, when used of <i>persons</i> in the active voice, has usually or always a bad sense, implying some breach of fidelity, honor, etc., the leaving of something which the person should rightfully stand by and support; as, to <i>desert</i> one's colors, to <i>desert</i> one's post, to <i>desert</i> one's principles or duty. When used in the passive, the sense is not necessarily bad; as, the fields were <i>deserted</i>, a <i>deserted</i> village, <i>deserted</i> halls. <i>Forsake</i> implies the breaking off of previous habit, association, personal connection, or that the thing left had been familiar or frequented; as, to forsake old friends, to <i>forsake</i> the paths of rectitude, the blood <i>forsook</i> his cheeks. It may be used either in a good or in a bad sense.</p><p><b style="color: #00b">Abandon</b>, <i style="color: #a00">n.</i> [F. <span style="color: #8B4513">abandon</span>. fr. <span style="color: #8B4513">abandonner</span>.
